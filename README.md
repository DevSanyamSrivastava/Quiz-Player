This JavaScript code creates a simple quiz application. Here’s a breakdown of its components and how it works:

### Components and Functionality

1. **Data Structure** (`questions` array): The quiz questions are stored in an array of objects, where each object contains:
   - `question`: The text of the question.
   - `answers`: An array of possible answers, with each answer having `text` (answer text) and `correct` (boolean indicating if it’s the correct answer).

2. **DOM Elements**:
   - `questionElement`: Displays the current question text.
   - `answerButtons`: Holds the answer buttons.
   - `nextButton`: A button to go to the next question or restart the quiz after completion.

3. **Variables**:
   - `currentQuestionIndex`: Keeps track of the current question index.
   - `score`: Keeps track of the correct answers.

### Main Functions

1. **`startQuiz`**: Initializes the quiz by setting `currentQuestionIndex` and `score` to 0, and shows the first question.

2. **`showQuestion`**: Displays the current question and its answer choices.
   - **`resetState`** is called to clear previous answers and hide the "Next" button.
   - Loops through each answer, creating a button for each one, and assigns the correct answer using `dataset.correct`.

3. **`resetState`**: Clears the answer buttons and hides the "Next" button until an answer is selected.

4. **`selectAnswer`**: Handles the logic when an answer is selected.
   - Checks if the selected answer is correct, updating the score if true.
   - Disables all buttons and highlights the correct answer(s) in green and incorrect answer (if any) in red.
   - Displays the "Next" button after an answer is chosen.

5. **`showScore`**: Displays the final score after the quiz ends and provides an option to replay the quiz by changing the "Next" button to "Play Again".

6. **`handleNextButton`**: Moves to the next question or shows the score if all questions are answered.

7. **Event Listeners**:
   - The `nextButton` event listener checks if there are more questions. If there are, it moves to the next question; otherwise, it restarts the quiz.

### Summary of Usage

This script dynamically generates questions and answers, tracks the user's score, and displays a final score after the last question. The `startQuiz()` function is called initially to start the quiz.

### Potential Improvements

- Add feedback after each question to indicate if the answer was correct or incorrect.
- Enhance styling for better UX.
- Introduce a timer for each question to increase difficulty.
- Save high scores using `localStorage` to make it more engaging.
